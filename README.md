android-tickerlistview
======================

This project shows how a simple listview can be implemented in android with ticker like animation (right to left slide in) which gets updated after fixed time. On execution, it will display a new list item after every 4 seconds to simulate ticker like functionality. I used these 2 tutorials to implement it => http://www.learn2crack.com/2013/10/android-custom-listview-images-text-example.html and http://karnshah8890.blogspot.de/2013/04/listview-animation-tutorial.html 

Screen will look like this : ![alt tag](https://github.com/wahibhaq/android-tickerlistview/blob/master/screenshot.png)
